# Expense_tracker
In my Expense Tracker project, I created a single-page app that allows users to add income or expense transactions, calculate the current balance, and save their data using LocalStorage. I  dynamically rendered the transaction list and totals based on user input, and handled the delete functionality. 
A simple and clean web-based Expense Tracker built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project helps users to track their income and expenses while visualizing their balance dynamically. It uses **LocalStorage** to store data persistently in the browser.
